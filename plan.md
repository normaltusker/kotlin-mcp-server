# Kotlin MCP Server - Next Generation Enhancement Plan

Our goal is to evolve the server from a powerful tool provider into a truly proactive and intelligent development partner. This plan is broken down into three main phases.

---

### Phase 1: Deepening the Foundational Tooling (COMPLETE)

This phase focuses on making the core tools more robust and comprehensive to handle more complex, real-world scenarios.

*   **1.1. Advanced Git Operations:**
    *   **Task:** Extend the `git` tool with sub-commands for `branch`, `checkout`, `stash`, and `cherry-pick`.
    *   **Why:** This will allow the AI assistant to manage entire feature workflows, making it capable of handling more complex development tasks.

*   **1.2. More Powerful File System Operations:**
    *   **Task:** Add `move` and `rename` capabilities to the `file_system` tool. Add a "force" option for recursive deletion (with strong safety warnings).
    *   **Why:** This provides a more complete set of file manipulation primitives, essential for large-scale refactoring.

### Phase 2: Achieving True Project Mastery (COMPLETE)

This phase is about making the AI's understanding of the project's code and architecture much deeper and more precise.

*   **2.1. Robust Dependency Analysis:**
    *   **Task:** Replace the current keyword-based dependency scanning with a proper analysis tool by running a Gradle task (like `gradle dependencies`) and parsing the output.
    *   **Why:** This will give the server precise information about every library and its version, enabling truly intelligent suggestions.

*   **2.2. Architectural Pattern Enforcement:**
    *   **Task:** Enhance the `scaffold` and `create_kotlin_file` tools to learn and enforce the project's specific architectural patterns by analyzing existing modules.
    *   **Why:** This will ensure that AI-generated code is indistinguishable from code written by the project's lead developers.

*   **2.3. Comprehensive Proactive Analysis:**
    *   **Task:** Expand the proactive analyzer to continuously scan for performance issues, security vulnerabilities, and deviations from best practices.
    *   **Why:** This transforms the assistant from a reactive helper to a proactive guardian of code quality.

### Phase 3: Building a Seamless, Integrated Workflow (COMPLETE)

This phase focuses on making the integrations with external services more interactive and actionable.

*   **3.1. Interactive Issue Tracking:**
    *   **Task:** Enhance the `tickets` tool with `comment`, `assign`, and `close` capabilities.
    *   **Why:** This will enable complete, automated workflows between version control and issue tracking.

*   **3.2. Actionable Design Integration:**
    *   **Task:** Enhance the `design` tool to extract design tokens (colors, fonts) and write them into the project's theme files, and to attempt to generate Compose UI from a Figma component.
    *   **Why:** This will dramatically accelerate the process of turning designs into code.

*   **3.3. CI/CD with Automated Feedback Loop:**
    *   **Task:** Improve the `ci` tool to fetch test results and logs from a failed build and automatically feed them into the `debug` tool for analysis.
    *   **Why:** This creates a powerful automated feedback loop, significantly reducing debugging time.
