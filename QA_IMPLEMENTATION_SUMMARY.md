## 🚀 Usage Instructions

### Quick Start
```bash
# Install all dependencies and setup development environment
make setup-dev

# Run quick development checks
make dev-check

# Run complete quality pipeline
make ci

# Check for breaking changes
python breaking_change_monitor.py
```

### Daily Development Workflow
1. Make code changes
2. Run `make dev-check` for quick validation
3. Commit changes (pre-commit hook runs automatically)
4. Push to repository (CI pipeline runs automatically)

### Before Major Releases
```bash
# Run complete quality assurance
make all

# Update breaking change baseline
python breaking_change_monitor.py --update-baseline

# Prepare release
make release-prep
```

## 🛡️ Protection Against Breaking Changes

### Automatic Detection
The system automatically detects:
- **Missing Tools** - If any MCP tools are removed
- **Tool Failures** - If previously working tools start failing
- **Performance Regressions** - If operations become significantly slower

- **Import Errors** - If any server modules fail to load

### Prevention Mechanisms
- **Pre-Commit Hooks** - Catch basic issues before commit
- **CI/CD Gates** - Prevent merging of breaking changes
- **Test Coverage Requirements** - Ensure new code is tested
- **Lint Enforcement** - Maintain code quality standards
